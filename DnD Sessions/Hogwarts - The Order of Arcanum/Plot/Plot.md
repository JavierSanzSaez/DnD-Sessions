### Plot Framework: “The Order of Arcanum”

#### Setting:

It’s the late 1800s, and magical knowledge is advancing rapidly across Europe. The wizarding world is embracing new magical discoveries and inventions. However, with these advancements comes the need for specialized education beyond what is offered in traditional magical institutions like Hogwarts. This gives rise to the need for an advanced study program focused on adult wizards.

#### Plot Idea:

The Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards have become increasingly concerned with the rapid spread of dark and uncontrolled magic across Europe. This era has seen a rise in obscure magical practices, unregulated dueling, cursed artifacts, and wild magical experimentation. To combat these emerging threats, the Ministry creates an elite, intensive retraining program called the **Order of Arcanum**.

The Order is based within the hallowed halls of Hogwarts but is exclusively for adult wizards who show untapped potential or possess skills that need refinement. The goal is to create a cohort of highly trained magical operatives capable of handling these growing threats. Your players would be part of this first experimental class.
#### **Premise:**

The Order of Arcanum has uncovered a hidden chamber within Hogwarts that dates back to the school’s founders. The chamber was intended as a secret testing ground where only those worthy of inheriting the founders’ knowledge could enter. The session revolves around the players exploring this chamber, learning powerful spells linked to the founders themselves, and passing ancient trials that test their magical prowess and character.

#### **Plot Summary:**

The players are chosen to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime event at Hogwarts: exploring the **Hall of Forgotten Arts**, a hidden part of the castle that can only be opened once every century. It’s said that those who complete the trials within the hall will gain access to ancient spells tied to the four founders: Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff, and Salazar Slytherin. However, the hall is filled with complex puzzles, magical traps, and creatures that will push the players to their limits.

#### **Session Structure:**

You can break this session into three acts that highlight different aspects of spellcasting, teamwork, and puzzle-solving.

### **Act 1: Entry to the Hall of Forgotten Arts (45 minutes)**

- The session begins with the players gathering in a forgotten corridor deep within Hogwarts. Their guide, an eccentric professor specializing in lost magic, explains that the hall only opens once every 100 years. As they open the passage, the players feel a surge of magic in the air, and the door seals behind them.
- Inside the hall, they find themselves in a grand, echoing chamber lined with enchanted portraits of the four founders, each guarding a different pathway. To move forward, the players must solve a puzzle or pass a trial that reflects the values of each founder.

**Example Trials:**

- **Gryffindor’s Trial:** The players face an illusion of a fearsome creature (like a dragon or chimera). The challenge is not only to defeat it but to show bravery in the face of overwhelming odds—this could involve choosing to protect each other or using creative teamwork to overcome the beast.
- **Ravenclaw’s Trial:** The players must solve a complex riddle or magical puzzle, such as arranging enchanted runes or casting spells in a precise sequence to unlock a hidden door.
- **Hufflepuff’s Trial:** The players encounter a magical obstacle that requires cooperation and loyalty to overcome. For example, they must pass through a series of doors that only open if the group acts selflessly or helps each other in specific ways.
- **Slytherin’s Trial:** The players face a test of cunning, such as navigating a room filled with magical traps. This could involve figuring out how to disable wards, bypass illusions, or outsmart a magically bound creature.

After passing these trials, the players reach a central chamber where they are each offered a choice: to learn an advanced spell tied to one of the founders’ magical legacies.

### **Act 2: Choosing Your Magical Path (45 minutes)**

- In the heart of the hall, the players find four ancient spellbooks, each tied to one of the founders. As they approach, each book glows with a different color, inviting them to choose a path.
- **Mechanics:** Allow each player to choose a school of magic associated with one of the founders. Once chosen, they gain a new spell reflecting the chosen founder’s magic, enhancing their abilities for the session (and possibly beyond if this adventure is tied to future ones).

**Example Spell Schools:**

- **Gryffindor’s Fire Magic:** Offers spells focused on offense and protection, like an upgraded version of _Fireball_ or a defensive spell that wards off dark magic.
- **Ravenclaw’s Arcane Knowledge:** Grants access to powerful divination or utility spells, like _Detect Thoughts_, _Counterspell_, or _Misty Step_.
- **Hufflepuff’s Healing and Support:** Unlocks restorative spells like _Mass Healing Word_, _Protection from Energy_, or an aura that bolsters allies’ defenses.
- **Slytherin’s Dark Curses and Manipulation:** Offers access to potent control or debuff spells, like _Bestow Curse_, _Dominate Person_, or an ability to temporarily drain life from enemies.

Once each player chooses, the chamber shifts, revealing a hidden staircase leading further down into the hall. However, they’re warned that accepting this knowledge means they must complete one final trial before they can leave.

### **Act 3: The Final Trial—The Founders’ Sentinel (1 hour)**

- The players enter a vast, darkened chamber at the bottom of the staircase. In the center stands a towering statue—a fusion of the four founders’ likenesses. As they approach, the statue animates, becoming a guardian of the hall that tests whether they’re truly worthy of the power they’ve gained.
- The Sentinel embodies the strengths of all four founders, attacking with a mix of fire magic (Gryffindor), psychic assaults (Ravenclaw), poison or entangling vines (Hufflepuff), and curses (Slytherin). The players must use the new spells they’ve learned to counter its attacks and exploit its weaknesses.
- **Dynamic Combat:** The chamber could have shifting platforms, magical hazards (like enchanted flames or cursed fog), and elements tied to the founders’ magic, forcing the players to adapt and strategize.

### **Aftermath: The Reward and Revelation (30 minutes)**

- After defeating the Sentinel, the hall presents the players with a final choice: they can keep the powerful spells they’ve learned, but only if they swear an oath to protect Hogwarts from future threats—essentially binding themselves as guardians of its legacy.
- As they exit the hall, they’re returned to their professor, who praises them for their success and hints that there may be more hidden chambers throughout Hogwarts yet to be discovered—perhaps foreshadowing future adventures.
